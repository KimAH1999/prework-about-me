      <p>Growing up my mom tried to push me into the medical field because they were known to making more money and I knew I adored helping others. I've been arguing against myself with my future plans. Now I made up my mind and I am striving to reach my goal to become a computer analyst. Back in high school, I was in the Robotics Club for 3 years and for the last year I was the team leader and I was in my happiest monent compared to my Health Academy that I was also attending for 4 years in High school.</p>
