## Description
As a first project, the start of the learning journey has commmenced by understanding the full creation on creating a html website. As a topic I started to expalin myself and show my new skill in this URL.
- This website is a static HTML website using semantic tags and minimal CSS. 
- This project was created as an assignment to show my skills and to revisit in the future to see my progress overall.
- This topic was not only informative, but was benifitial to test out my code in Github and see how this new website can help make everything helpful and organized.
- I have gained a lot of insight to other users and classmates on tips and tricks while learning this first step.

## Installation Usage(note)
OUTLINE FOR CREATING WEBSITE:
/*<!DOCTYPE html>*/
/*<html lang="en-us">*/

/*<head>*/
  /*<(...anyhting in header like title, usually, is <meta>,<link>,<title>.)>*/
/*</head>*/

/*<body>*/
  /*<(...anything between "body" can be <div>,<p>,<h1>,...)>*/
/*</body>*/
  
/*</html>*/
